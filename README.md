# 📝 To-Do List App

A simple and interactive To-Do List application built using React.  
This app allows users to add, edit, complete, and delete tasks with a clean UI. 




## 🚀 Features (Detailed Explanation)

### ➕ Add Tasks
Users can enter a task in the input field and click the **Add** button to create a new task.  
Each task is assigned a unique ID and displayed instantly in the task list.

### ✏️ Edit Tasks
Clicking the **Edit** button loads the selected task into the input field.  
The **Add** button dynamically changes to **Update**, allowing users to modify and save changes without refreshing the page.

### ✅ Complete Tasks
When a task is marked as **Complete**, it is moved from the active task list to a separate **Completed Tasks** section.  
Completed tasks no longer display action buttons.

### 🗑 Delete Tasks
Users can permanently remove any task from the active task list by clicking the **Delete** button.

### 🔄 Dynamic UI Updates
The application uses React’s `useState` hook to update the UI in real time without page reloads.

### 📂 Separate Task Sections
Tasks are categorized into:
- **To Be Completed**
- **Completed Tasks**

This improves clarity and task management.
